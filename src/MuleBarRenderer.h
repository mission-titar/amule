 * renderer instance, registered via CMuleDataViewCtrl::AppendBarColumn(), serves any list that
 * wants a bar column. It matches the flat/3D and border-drawing behaviour every existing CBarShader
 * caller already has, since those come from a global preference (thePrefs::UseFlatBar()) rather
 * than anything list-specific.
 *
 * The CBarShader is a renderer member, not a per-Render() local: SetWidth()/SetHeight() reset its
 * content buffer, so it must not be resized more than once per paint, and rebuilding one from
 * scratch per cell per repaint would be wasteful -- the same reason the pre-port code kept it as a
 * function-local static.
