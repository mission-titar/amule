#ifndef PARTBARLEGEND_H
#define PARTBARLEGEND_H

// The palette of the chunk-bar columns -- the two in the client lists and the source-availability
// one in the shared-files list -- and the legends the row context menu opens to explain them.
//
// The point of this header is that there is exactly one copy of each colour. A legend that restated
// the palette, in words or in swatches filled from a second set of constants, would be free to
// drift away from the pixels it claims to explain, and nothing would fail when it did. Here the
// renderer and the legend both read SourcePartColour()/PeerPartColour(), so a colour can only
// change for both at once.
//
// "One copy of each colour" is a rule about definitions, not about values. Two constants may hold
// the same RGB when they mean different things and never appear in the same legend -- kNextPending
// and kFlatHashPending do -- so the no-two-rows-alike invariant is scoped PER LEGEND: within one
// legend a repeated colour is a distinction the reader cannot see; across two it is a coincidence.
//
// It pulls in nothing but <cstddef>/<cstdint>, ClientListColumns.h and PartBarSpans.h -- itself wx-
// free -- so what a legend lists, in which order, in which colour, and which legend a column gets
// is all reachable from a unit test with no wx, no app and no display session. What is left needing
// a display is the drawing itself.
